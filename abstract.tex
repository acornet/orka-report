As users rely more on their mobile devices, energy inefficient software 
is a real threat to user experience. Early tools for developers focussed 
on expensive power measurement hardware and software-based approaches 
were introduced to relieve them of such requirements. These tools 
highlighted the most energy-inefficient routines of the code, but the 
developer still had to find and understand the exact causes of energy 
drain. Also, there was no mapping of hardware energy activity to code 
and accounting for tail energy. To this end, this work focusses on 
providing source-line level energy estimates and maps the drain caused 
by Wi-Fi back to the code while accounting for tail-energy.
